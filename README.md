The layout is implemented for several machine learning models. The layout allows you to:

- choose a dataset
- select the target attribute
- select speakers for training
- delete lines with omissions
- choose models for training,
- to produce training,
- to view the results of training, including in the form of graphs.
The framework used for development: streamlit
